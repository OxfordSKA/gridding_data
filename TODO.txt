* Visualise (movie?) uvw plane coordinates of each observation.
* Number of frequency channels?
* Data format?
    - Data size? (1GB) vs number of correlator dumps?
* Convert setup.ini to scripts
    - Image visibilities for a range of widefield imaging options in CASA
    - Speed up image testing by using im tool rather than CLEAN?
        - Verify the output for 4.3
        - Record imaging timings for various widefield options.
* Run on cambridge HPC rather than laptop...
* Create short document on the simulations (PDF or webpage. - SDP wiki?)
* Better source position generation ? (if approx L shape isn't ok)
* Range of times and pointings to give reasonable UVW coverage
